# bunching
`bunching` allows the user to conduct bunching analysis in a kink or notch setting and returns a rich set of results.  Important features of the package include functionality to control for (different levels of) round-number bunching or other bunching masses within the estimation bandwidth, options to split bins by placing the bunching point as the minimum, median or maximum in its bin (for robustness analysis), and estimates of both parametric and reduced-form versions of elasticities associated with the bunching mass. It also provides an exploratory viusalization function to speed up pre-analysis, and  produces plots in the Chetty et al. (2011) style with lots of options on editing the plot appearance. Further, it returns bootstrapped vectors of estimates of all the main estimable parameters (bunching mass, elasticity, marginal buncher, dominated region, fraction in dominated region in notch setting, etc.) which can be used for further analysis, e.g. incorporation into structural models that rely on bunching moments.
