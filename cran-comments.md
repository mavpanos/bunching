## Resubmission
This is a new submission, for package already on CRAN.
In this new submission, I have: 
* updated the licence
* fixed typos in vignettes


## Test environments
* local OS Mojave install, R  3.6.1
* ubuntu 16.04.6 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.1
* win-builder (devel and R-hub)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs

There was 1 NOTE when testing using win-builder:

checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE Maintainer: 'Panos Mavrokonstantis mavpanos@gmail.com'
According to CRAN maintainer Uwe Ligges, "This is just a Note that reminds CRAN maintainers to check that the submission comes actually from his maintainer and not anybody else". Source: https://mailman.stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2014-March/068497.html
